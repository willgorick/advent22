<b>Howdy!  Welcome to my 2022 Advent of Code repository!</b>

In order to run your code in this repo, you will need to add a .env file with your session cookie from the advent of code site.  To access this, login to your account at https://adventofcode.com/ and inspect the page, then grab the `session` cookie (this process will be slightly different depending on your browser).  Once you've acquired the cookie, save it in your .env file in the format `session: {cookie}`

In order to start actually working, you can copy the `day0` folder, modifying the name to a new `day{number}` folder and simply add your solution to the `solve()` function inside the part1.py file.

As you may have noticed from the command above, this repository uses Python3.  Attempting to run it with older Python will not work.
